            <h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
            <p>Since March 8, 1990, Woman’s Day is being observed by SAARC 
                <br>(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) consisting of seven countries, namely, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.
                 The day was marked to focus on the problems of girl children in these countries. <br> 
                It is a pity that girl children especially in underdeveloped countries are victims of extreme negligence and dishonour. <br>
                 The birth of a girl child is looked upon by the parents as a cause of pity. <br>
                 They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, economic facilities, and social status or honour. <br>
            Superstitions and social and religious prejudices give rise to such distressing conditions. <br>
             We must root out these prejudices and ensure a bright future for the girl children by giving them proper education. <br>
             Moreover, woman’s rights must be established in social and economic fields.</p>

            <p>Womanhood is the period in a human female's life after <br>
                she has passed through childhood, puberty, and adolescence. <br>
                [12][better source needed] Different countries have different laws, but age 18 is frequently  <br>
                considered the age of majority (the age at which a person is legally considered an adult).</p>
                <p>he word girl originally meant "young person of either sex" in English;[13] it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a female child.[14]
